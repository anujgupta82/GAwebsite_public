                AI is making waves in the highest echelons of power and

                <li>
                  Chegg suffered a drastic 50% loss in market capitalization
                  overnight due to the emergence of ChatGPT.

                <li>
                  In a strategic move, Google has merged its DeepMind and Google
                  Brain teams to capitalize on the AI revolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  OpenAI, on the other hand, has garnered significant attention
                  and is now among the most sought-after teams globally.
                </li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                AI has become a prominent topic in influential circles and
                boardrooms worldwide. Your competitors have already recognized
                this reality. The question remains: What steps are you taking to
                address and leverage this transformative force?
              </p>

              <p>
                To leverage AI effectively for market dominance and increased
                revenue streams, your organization needs to understand the
                crucial concept of “Doing AI Right.” Simply obtaining a good AI
                model accounts for only 10% of the equation. Relying solely on
                engineers to develop and deploy deep learning models is not a
                comprehensive AI strategy.
              </p>

              <p>
                ~87% of AI/ML projects fail to make it into production, let
                alone deliver successful business outcomes. This is because a
                successful AI project that generates tangible ROI requires much
                more than just a good model. While technical modeling has
                received significant attention in recent years, other critical
                factors have been overlooked. This workshop fills that gap by
                addressing the remaining 90% — revealing the secret ingredients
                and strategies to “do AI right” and fully leverage AI’s
                potential.

                  holistic approach to AI is essential for your entire
                  organization, particularly senior leaders. This workshop aims

              <p>
                This two-day workshop uncovers the essential aspects of AI to

                Achieving <strong>“AI magic” </strong>and unlocking AI’s full
                potential requires organizational
                <strong>“AI maturity”.</strong> Successful AI systems are very
                different from traditional software engineering, necessitating a
                deep understanding of the four pillars: Technology, People,
                Processes & Economics. The workshop provides a comprehensive
                exploration of these pillars and their synergistic interplay for
                optimal results.

                Join us for this workshop, delving into the often-neglected 90%
                and gaining insights into the three pillars of AI—technology,
                people, and processes—that are integral to achieving “AI magic.”
                This workshop will not touch any code or mathematical
                underpinnings of AI.
              </p>

              <h5>Target audience</h5>
              <p>
                This workshop caters to a wide range of professionals, including
                Product Managers (from entry level to Head of Product), UX
                designers, User Researchers, Engineering Leaders (from team
                manager to Head of Engineering), Business Leaders (from line
                manager to Chief Business Officer), Leaders from Sales teams,
                senior HR/TA/HRBP leaders, CXOs, Founders, CEOs, and individuals
                working at VC firms.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you’re an AI engineer/IC facing challenges where your AI
                solutions don’t make it into production or fail to impact the
                company’s revenue, this workshop is designed specifically for
                you.
              </p>

              <h5>Why attend this workshop</h5>
              <p>
                In today’s world, integrating AI into your product offering is
                no longer a choice. The global trend towards automation and
                intelligence necessitates proactive exploration of AI
                opportunities to create intelligent touchpoints. These include
                AI-powered features and workflows that enhance user experience
                and transform them into super users. Similar to how Robert
                Downey Jr. dons the Iron Man suit, providing this armor suit for
                your users is no longer optional but necessary for every product
                manager.
              </p>

              <p>
                Consequently, every product team and organization must adopt an
                “AI-first” mindset. Merely having engineers developing models is
                insufficient to achieve favorable business outcomes. The entire
                organization, particularly product teams, senior stakeholders,
                business leaders, CXOs, and founders, must embrace an AI-first
                approach. This workshop precisely addresses these requirements.
              </p>

              <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
              <p>
                You will learn in-depth what it takes to build AI products that
                create new revenue streams and an edge for your organization in

              <strong>In-person workshop</strong>
              <p>
                This workshop will be held <strong>in person</strong> on a
                <strong>Friday & Saturday</strong> at the

              <strong>What is so very different about this workshop</strong>
              <p>
                In the last decade, most of the educational material (university
                courses, upskilling courses, books, lectures) on AI focuses on
                engineers or have an engineer first approach. This workshop
                addresses the often overlooked 90% of AI that goes beyond
                building models. Just as Coca-Cola’s secret formula sets it
                apart from others, this workshop delves into the “secret
                ingredients” of AI implementation. By discussing and
                democratizing this vital 90%, the workshop aims to empower
                individuals across various roles in organizations to thrive in
                the AI landscape.
              </p>

                >Unlike everyone, why does this workshop focus on non-AI
                teams</strong
              >
              <p>
                AI serves as a powerful tool to achieve market dominance and
                generate new revenue streams for businesses. In an AI-first
                world, the entire organization, including product, business,
                sales, and HR teams, must adopt an AI-first mindset to be able
                to do AI right. To enable this shift, it is essential to provide
                educational material tailored to the specific roles and needs of
                product, HR, and sales/business teams. This workshop aims to
                fulfill that purpose by equipping participants with the
                knowledge and insights necessary to thrive in the AI landscape
                and contribute effectively to their respective roles in the AI
                war.
